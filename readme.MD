# Simple Backend over Node.js
I'm so bored and 4 that reason i've made this thing.

1. for make it work u need to install the packages via npm with `npm install` or `npm i` or whatever
2. make sure u have an mssql server active and check what is tfking port for it, in my case was the port `1434`
3. run the `query.sql` that is present in this repository
4. test the shitty db
5. idk, improve the frontend?


note: i hate chatgpt and deepdick
